# Embedded-Systems-1
This project is part of the "Embedded and Real-Time Systems" at Aristole University of Thessaloniki.
The aim of the code is to simulate the classic Producer-Consumer scenario with Pthreads using a Raspberry Pi zero.
We test different combinations of producers and consumers and examine the waiting times of the elements in the queue.



The code production was unsupervised
